Completed on: April 23, 2022 by: Guilherme Pereira

## Introduction

The purpose of this respository is to present my reflection on working through transitioning my MEAN stack application to the cloud using AWS. While this respitory does not go into detail with the technicality and code used to make this happen, I provide an explanation to how this system works and a generalization of the major AWS functions. Included in this repository is a link to my presentation along with a transcript of the video in PDF.
